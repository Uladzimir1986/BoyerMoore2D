# PatternSearch2D
PatternSearch2D counts number of occurrences of specific two-dimensional text pattern in text.

The algorithm is implementation of the idea from paper: "A Boyer-Moore Approach for Two-Dimensional Matching"
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ec0b/8b247b9a6efdbe8b3ddc2e4e3547cecf5223.pdf

This implementation is modified for arbitrary shapes of pattern and text.
Average case complexity is sub-linear. Worst time complexity is O(m^2n^2).

Example:
----------------



    python pattern_search_2D.py -p pattern.txt -t text.txt
